Introduction
-------------------
Docker is a highly optimized platform for building and running containers on servers.
It manage containers in a highly efficient manner and works incredibly well with Ansible.
This introduction is base on RHEL/CentOs OS.
For example please see the docker_deploy.yml file.

Prerequisites
-------------------
Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:
Ansible installed on your machine.


Edit Ansible playbook
-------------------
Create a new Ansible playbook. The directory layout should look like:
docker_project/
    docker_deploy.yml
	

Edit ansible playbook file to pull and run the image
-------------------
The playbook uses the pull image and run docker container.
We need to provide name for the image, and set the state parameter of the image to be started to run the contanier.

The playbook file should look like:
	
	- name: Run container image
	hosts: <HOST NAME>
	become: true

    tasks:
	- name: Pull docker image
      docker_image:
        name: ob7777/ci-spring-showcase:latest

    - name: Running docker container
      docker_container:
        name: ci-spring-showcase
        image: ob7777/ci-spring-showcase:latest
        state: started
        ports:
        - "8080:8080"
        detach: true


Prerequisites on the deployed machine:
-------------------
Ansible playbook need to install docker-py on the Docker host.
Ansibleâ€™s Docker integration requires you to install this python library.
We use pip to install the required python library. So we add also a task that install pip before docker-py.

The playbook file should look like:

	- name: Adding epel-release package
      yum: name=epel-release state=latest

    - name: Install pip
      yum: name=python-pip state=present

    - name: Install docker-py
      pip: name=docker-py


Running the playbook
-------------------
Run the playbook by using the following command on your workstation:
	$ ansible-playbook <playbook file name>.yml 

e.g:
	$ ansible-playbook docker_deploy.yml
